# Images
In this project, I created a program that creates a 4*4 image whit all possible combinations (black and white). 

How does it work:

1) Download the files.
2) Unzip the folder.
3) You will find 3 images, one is in BMP format, and the other one is in PNG format.
4) You will find one .py files where you can modify the code as you like (please don't judge my code).
5) You will find one white image, which is necessary for the code to run properly(basically the start image).
