# Images
In this project, I created a program that creates a 4*4 image whit all possible combinations (black and white). 

How does it work:

1) Download the files.
2) Unzip the folder.
3) You will find 4 images, 2 are in BMP format, and the other two are in PNG format.
4) You will also find two different .py files where you can modify the code as you like (please don't judge my code).
